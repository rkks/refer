Universal TUN/TAP device driver.
TUN/TAP provides packet reception and transmission for user space programs. 
It can be viewed as a simple Point-to-Point or Ethernet device, which 
instead of receiving packets from a physical media, receives them from 
user space program and instead of sending packets via physical media 
writes them to the user space program.
