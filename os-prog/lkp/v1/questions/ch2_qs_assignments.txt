Chapter 2 : Questions and/or Assignments

1. (If you haven't already done so) follow this chapter's directions to do the
following:
   a. Download the v5.4 Linux kernel source tree.
   b. Extract it.
   c. Configure the kernel (begin by using the localmodconfig approach, 
      then tweak as required).
   d. Show the "delta" â€“ the differences between the old (or original) and the
      new kernel config file (tip: use the diffconfig script to do so).

2. On the kernel code base, build support for both the ctags and cscope
code browsing tools; use them in an interactive fashion
(tip: using make help reveals the relevant targets for ctags/cscope.)

3. A bit more ambitious: clone Linus Torvalds's Git tree and configure it.
