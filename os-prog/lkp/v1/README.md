**Linux Kernel Programming, published by Packt**

## What is this book about?
Linux Kernel Programming is a comprehensive introduction for those new to Linux kernel and module development. This easy-to-follow guide will have you up and running with writing kernel code in next-to-no time. This book uses the latest 5.4 Long-Term Support (LTS) Linux kernel, which will be maintained from November 2019 through to December 2025. By working with the 5.4 LTS kernel throughout the book, you can be confident that your knowledge will continue to be valid for years to come. 

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Write high-quality modular kernel code (LKM framework) for 5.x kernels
* Configure and build a kernel from source
* Explore the Linux kernel architecture
* Get to grips with key internals regarding memory management within the kernel
* Understand and work with various dynamic kernel memory alloc/dealloc APIs
Discover key internals aspects regarding CPU scheduling within the kernel
Gain an understanding of kernel concurrency issues
Learn how to work with key kernel synchronization primitives

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, ch2.

The code will look like the following:
```
static int __init miscdrv_init(void)
{
	int ret;
	struct device *dev;
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for Linux programmers beginning to find their way with Linux kernel development. Linux kernel and driver developers looking to overcome frequent and common kernel development issues, as well as understand kernel internals, will benefit from this book. A basic understanding of Linux CLI and C programming is required.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-13).
### Software and Hardware List
| Chapter | Software required | OS required |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| 1-13 | Oracle VirtualBox 6.1 | Windows and Linux (Any) |

## Get to Know the Author
**Kaiwan N Billimoria**
taught himself BASIC programming on his dad's IBM PC back in 1983. He was programming in C and Assembly on DOS until he discovered the joys of Unix, and by around 1997, Linux!

Kaiwan has worked on many aspects of the Linux system programming stack, including Bash scripting, system programming in C, kernel internals, device drivers, and embedded Linux work. He has actively worked on several commercial/FOSS projects. His contributions include drivers to the mainline Linux OS and many smaller projects hosted on GitHub. His Linux passion feeds well into his passion for teaching these topics to engineers, which he has done for well over two decades now. He's also the author of Hands-On System Programming with Linux. It doesn't hurt that he is a recreational ultrarunner too.
