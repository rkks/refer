# Brief Description:
#
# Query the scheduling attributes (policy and RT (static) priority) of 
# all threads currently alive on the system. Just a simple wrapper around
# chrt(1).
# Tips: 
# - One can always pipe this output to grep for FIFO / RR tasks..
# - the tuna(8) program performs this and much more! check it out...
#
# For details, pl refer to the book Ch 10.
