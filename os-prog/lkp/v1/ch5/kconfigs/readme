These are sample kernel configs that you can try:

sample_kconfig_llkd_dbg.config  : for a 'debug' / dev kernel
sample_kconfig_llkd_prod.config : for a 'production' kernel

These have been generated for 5.4.0 Linux kernel on an x86_64 Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
system.

TIP:
You can run these (especially the 'production' one) against Alexander Popov's
interesting and useful security project kconfig-hardened-check.

git clone https://github.com/a13xp0p0v/kconfig-hardened-check

See the README.md and use it!
