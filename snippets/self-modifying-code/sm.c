/*	this is an example of self modifying code in C.

	it works for me, on a gnu/linux & gcc 2.95.4
	i have no idea if this is portable to other systems/compilers.
	there are no big reasons why it shouldn't be. if you try it out,
	please let me know how it went.

	the code was inspired by Karsten Scheibler's article
	"Using self modifying code under Linux" at linuxassembly.org
	(http://linuxassembly.org/articles/smc.html) and a guy from
	the web (whose name i had forgotten) asking around whether
	it was possible to write SMC in C. i was as courious as he was
	and this was one way to check it out. as you can see it (almost) is.
	i had to cheat just a bit and label my code from asm. ok,
	for the impatient: make; ./smc; echo $?

	if you have any questions feel free to contact me.

	happy coding.. */

	the injection never gets executed because when memcpy returns
	the execution will continue in the middle of our injected code
	and that is *bad*. sooo.. we can either inject into the loop
	and make sure the whole	new code fits inside..
	or start injecting over the "goto". that way injected code will
	get executed as soon as memcpy returns. also note, that that
	would not literally be self modifying code as we would be
	injecting over a code that has not yet run. now *thats*
	pointless. OTH we could completely change the insides of the loop
	and neatly pad potential leftover space with nops thus
	keeping the loop runing. */
