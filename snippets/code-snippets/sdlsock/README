sdlsock is a simple program to open a one-way TCP/IP connection for 
things like, for example, sending a standard 80-column text file to a 
postscript printer.

sdlsock address port < txtfile.txt

It uses SDL and SDL_net, but the static version has all that built in.  
The static version is x86 only.

The sdlsock code is freeware, and the SDL/SDL_net code is LGPL.
