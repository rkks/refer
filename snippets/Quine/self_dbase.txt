* Program:       Quine1.prg - a self-replicating cheat.
* Compiler:      Visual Foxpro 5.0
* Author:        Richard Katz (richkatz@earthlink.net)
* How it works:  The program simply lists itself.
* Notes:
* 1.  dBase was invented by Wayne Ratliff at Jet Propulsion Labs
*     and was orginally known as "Vulcan."  (See:
*     http://webopedia.internet.com/TERM/d/dBASE.html
*     http://www.cetus-links.org/oo_visual_foxpro.html)
* 2.  These lines that begin with "*" are comments.  They
*     may be included in the source, in which case, the
*     program will of course list them.
* 3.  First, save this program as quine1.prg
*     To run the program enter the command:
*             DO quine1.prg
* 4.  An interesting side effect of quine1 is that after you run
*     it, it creates a new copy of itself called quine2.prg
*     You can then run quine2.prg over and over, causing
*     it to rewrite itself from quine1.prg.
