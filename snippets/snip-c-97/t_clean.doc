      T_CLEAN - A utility for cleaning directories based on individual
                file time stamps.


Legal:  T_CLEAN is a free public domain utility. It is not guaranteed to do
        anything more than take up disk space. Specifically, it is provided
        "as is" without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied,
        including but not limited to the implied warranties of
        merchantability and fitness for any particular purpose.  

        The user of this program and documentation agrees to hold the
        author(s) of this material harmless for any direct or consequential
        damages resulting from its use.


Syntax: T_CLEAN directory [...directory] [-tN] [-l[FILE] [nrgi?]


At least one directory must be specified. Multiple directories may be
specified. Directory specifications may use either relative or absolute path
names.


Switches:   All switches are optional and may be either upper or lower case.
            Either "-" or "/" may be used as the switch lead-in character.

  -tN       The "-t" switch specifies the file age to begin purging,
            specified in days. For example, specifying "-t30" would delete
            all files older than 30 days. The default if "-t" is not
            specified is 14 days.

  -l[FILE]  The "-l" switch specifies a log file to record the activity of
            T_CLEAN. Note that the file name is optional, in which case the
            log data are directed to the console and may therefore be
            redirected or piped to another file or process.

  -n        The "-n" switch instructs T_CLEAN to process normally, but not to
            really delete anything. This is useful in combination with the
            "-l" switch in verifying operation before actually using T_CLEAN
            to delete files from a large or critical directory.

  -r        The "-r" switch instructs T_CLEAN to process all nested
            subdirectories of the specified directories.

  -g        The "-g" switch is used in combination with the "-r" switch to
            instruct T_CLEAN to try to delete nested subdirectories. Note
            that only empty subdirectories (either cleaned out by T_CLEAN or
            previously empty) are actually deleted.

  -i        The "-i" switch instructs T_CLEAN to ignore special file
            attributes, i.e. Hidden, Read only, or System files.

            *** NOTE *** Use the "-i" switch with extreme caution!!!

  -?        If you run T_CLEAN without specifying a directory or with one or
            more invalid switches, it will display a help screen and abort.
            You can also see the help screen by using the "-?" switch.


ERRORLEVEL: T_CLEAN returns an ERRORLEVEL of zero if successful, or non-zero
            in case of failure. In the case of a syntax error, the help
            screen is displayed and a non-zero ERRORLEVEL is returned. If the
            "-?" switch is invoked, the help screen is displayed and T_CLEAN
            returns a zero ERRORLEVEL.

            In the case of an internal failure, an error message is displayed
            and/or logged. If T_CLEAN can continue, it will do so. If the
            internal error prevents T_CLEAN from continuing, it will return
            with a non-zero ERRORLEVEL.


Technical:  T_CLEAN is supplied with complete source code. It has been
            compiled and tested using C compilers from Microsoft,Watcom,
            Symantec/Zortech, and Borland. The supplied executable was
            created using Zortech C ver. 3.0r4.
