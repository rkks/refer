Welcome to SNIPPETS!

  All the code I put into SNIPPETS for distribution is Public Domain or free
to the best that I can determine. What this means is that:

1.  I know or can contact the original author(s) to verify the presumed
    copyright ownership, and

2.  The work bears an explicit Public Domain notice, or

3.  The work is copyrighted but includes a free use license, or

4.  The work was published without a copyright notice prior to the effective
    date of the new copyright law.

  This has been occasionally annoying when I've had to pass up some useful
piece of code because it's questionable whether anyone can use it without
incurring liability (distributing someone else's property makes me an
accessory, doncha know).

  Since SNIPPETS includes both public domain and free code, be sure to
carefully read each header for any free license restrictions which may
apply.

  Portions of SNIPPETS are from my own MicroFirm Function Library (MFL).
These are provided for free, subject to the license restrictions specified in
the LICENSE.MFL file. Briefly, it says you can use the source files to create
programs for any use, even commercial distribution, but you can't sell the
source itself or object files (alone or in libraries) built from the source,
nor can you remove the copyright notice.
