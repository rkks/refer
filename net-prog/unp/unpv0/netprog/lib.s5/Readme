	The files here comprise the client and server library.
But, files that can be compiled with either CLIENT or SERVER
defined, are compiled as client functions.  This means that
directories that require SERVER versions, must make their
own link to the appropriate file in this directory.  This is
done, for example, by the tftp directory, since it needs a
version of error.c for the client and the server.  It has its
own link to error.c and just compiles it with either CLIENT
or SERVER defined.

	The rresvport() function distributed with WIN/TCP doesn't
appear to work right.  We've replaced it with the function in this
directory, which is a copy of the file from the ../rcmd directory,
modified to work with WIN/TCP.  This is needed for the lpr example
to work with WIN/TCP.
