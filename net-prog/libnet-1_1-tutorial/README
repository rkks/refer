libnet 1.1 tutorial (https://repolinux.wordpress.com/category/libnet/) sample code

File names are preceded by the order they appear in the tutorial.

To compile everything, just run
$ make

Notice that example 13 will fail to compile if your libnet version lacks libnet_build_icmpv6_echo() and libnet_autobuild_ipv6(). They are available starting from libnet-1.1.6 (https://github.com/sam-github/libnet/tree/master/libnet).
