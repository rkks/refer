Read the file called DISCLAIMER.

Some source changes needed to be made after the book went out for the first
printing.  I forgot to make corresponding changes in the source tree on the
system used to develop the book.  The changes are summarized below.

1. lib/recvfd.c and sockets/recvfd.c - needed sys/uio.h on Mac OS X
2. lib/sendfd.c and sockets/sendfd.c - needed sys/uio.h on Mac OS X
3. stdio/buf.c - added code for Mac OS X
4. threadctl/suspend.c - changed wait to waitloc to avoid symbol definition
	clash on Solaris
5. include/apue.h - FreeBSD compiles work better if we rely on the default
	system settings.  Solaris needed a different XOPEN_SOURCE definition
	and also a CMSG_LEN definition.

To build the source, edit the Make.defines.* file for your system and set
WKDIR to the pathname of the tree containing the source code.  Then just
run "make".  It should figure out the system type and build the source for
that platform automatically.  If you are running on a system other than
FreeBSD, Linux, Mac OS X, or Solaris, you'll need to modify the makefiles
to include the settings for your system.  Also, you'll probably need to
modify the source code to get it to build on a different operating system.
The example source was compiled and tested using FreeBSD 5.2.1, Linux 2.4.22,
Mac OS X 10.3, and Solaris 9.
