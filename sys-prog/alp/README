To compile and build the programs on most standard GNU/Linux systems,
simply invoke "make" from the top directory.  To clean up build
products, invoke "make clean".  Some program listings do not contain
complete, standalone programs; instead, they contain one or more
functions.  Such files are compiled to object files only.

See "Advanced Linux Programming" for information about the programs,
what they do, how they work, and how to use them.
