<h1>Java Smart Ticket Demo 1.2</h1>

<p>The Java Smart Ticket Demo is a sample application brought to
you by the <a href="http://java.sun.com/blueprints/wireless">Java
 BluePrints for the Wireless</a>
program at <a href="http://java.sun.com">Java Software</a>, <a
href="http://sun.com">Sun Microsystems</a>.</p>

<p>This sample application demonstrates how to use the capabilities of
the J2ME and J2EE platform to develop flexible, scalable, cross-platform
wireless end-to-end applications. It comes with full source code and
documentation, so you can experiment with J2ME&#153; and J2EE&#153; technologies and learn
how to use it to build your own wireless solutions.</p>

<p>To start using the demo, you must first <a href="admin/populating.jsp?forcefully=false"> populate the database</a>. (Be prepared to wait for a while as the database is populated.).</p>

<p>You may also forcefully <a href="admin/populating.jsp?forcefully=true"><b>repopulate
the demo's database</b></a>. This will remove all accounts that you may have already created. (Be prepared to wait for a while as the
database is populated.)</p>

<p>You can also use the <a href="portal/login.jsp">Web Application</a> to demonstrate the client/server synchronization.</p>

<h2>About Java BluePrints for Wireless</h2>

<p>The Java BluePrints for Wireless program defines the application programming
model for end to end wireless applications using both the J2ME&#153; and J2EE&#153; platforms. It provides best practice guidelines and
architectural recommendations for real-world application scenarios to
enable developers to build portable, scalable, and robust applications
using the J2ME and J2EE technologies.</p>
