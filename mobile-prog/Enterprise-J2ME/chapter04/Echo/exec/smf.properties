# IBM Service Management Framework properties file
#
# This file contains properties used by both SMF and
# SMF Bundle Developer.  The property values are
# set by SMF when it is started.  Any value set in
# this file will override the default value derived
# by SMF.

# The setting of the default values will be done in
# com.ibm.osg.smf.Framework.java.  Only uncomment the value
# if overriding the default.

# The location of this file can be specified by the
# property com.ibm.osg.smf.properties on the command
# line when invoking SMF. The default is equivalent to:
# -Dcom.ibm.osg.smf.properties=smf.properties

# This is a list of package descriptions (see Export-Package
# manifest header description) of additional packages available
# on the system classpath. Packages described here will
# allow bundles which imports a listed package to resolve.
#com.ibm.osg.smf.systempackages=<package-description>

# This is the directory in which the DefaultPlaform
# persistently stores the installed bundles and permission
# information. The default is "bundles"
# NOTE: The contents of this directory will be entirely
# owned by SMF and may be changed or deleted.
com.ibm.osg.smf.bundledir=jarbundles

# This is the directory in which the FlashPlatform
# persistently stores the installed bundles and permission
# information.
# NOTE: The contents of directory will be entirely
# owned by SMF and may be changed or deleted.
#com.ibm.osg.smf.flashBundlesDataDirectory=bundlesData

# This is the size in bytes of the buffers used by
# bundle ClassLoaders when they need to create a buffer
# to read a class or resource from a bundle.
# The default value is 8024 bytes.
#com.ibm.osg.smf.loader.buffersize=8024

# This is the number of seconds to wait after a Driver service
# unregistration before attempting to reattach idle device services.
# If this property is not set, a value of 5 seconds will be used.
com.ibm.osg.service.device.updatewait=5

# If this property is set, and no Http Service port configuration
# exists in Configuration Admin, then Http Service will listen
# on the default port specified by org.osgi.service.http.port
# If this property is not set and no Http Service port
# configurations exist in Configuration Admin, then Http Service
# will NOT listen on any ports!
com.ibm.osg.service.http.defaultports=8081

# Default http port. See com.ibm.osg.service.http.defaultports.
org.osgi.service.http.port=8081

# The org.osgi.framework.* properties can be modified for
# the specifics of the deployment to override the default
# values from the JVM system properties.

# Default value is the value of the system property os.arch
org.osgi.framework.processor=x86

# Default value is the value of the system property os.name
org.osgi.framework.os.name=Mac OS X

# Default value is the value of the system property os.version
# (up to the first space, if any)
#org.osgi.framework.os.version=5.0

# Default value is the value of the system property user.language
#org.osgi.framework.language=en

# This property can be used to define additional packages which
# contain URL protocol handlers for SMF. The Handler class in these
# packages can implement the BundleActivator interface. If they
# do, SMF will call their BundleActivator.start method when they are
# constructed, passing the BundleContext for the system bundle.
# See java.protocol.handler.pkgs for the format of the
# property value.
#com.ibm.osg.smf.protocol.handler.pkgs=

# Default stationid
# Ideally this would be a burned-in address
com.ibm.osg.smf.stationid=78

# Default hardware type
#com.ibm.osg.smf.hardware.type=pc

# Default hardware model
#com.ibm.osg.smf.hardware.model=clone

# Default hardware version
#com.ibm.osg.smf.hardware.version=unknown

# Endianness of the platform.
# Possible values are "le" (little) & "be" (big).
# Default value is "le".
#com.ibm.osg.smf.endian=le

# Default address length.
# Possible values are 32 and 64.
# Default value is 32
#com.ibm.osg.smf.addresslength=32

# Java Virtual Machine name
# Default value from the system property java.vm.name
# J9 sets it to "J9"
#com.ibm.osg.smf.vm=

# The ImplType states that the framework is running on the corresponding
# J9 class library.
# Possible values:
#   JCL_GatewayPlus_1_3 (maps to com.ibm.oti.configuration values "rm" & "gwp")
#   JCL_Foundation_1_3 (maps to com.ibm.oti.configuration value "foun")
#   JCL_Max_1_3 (maps to com.ibm.oti.configuration value "max")
# Value is empty for any other configuration or if not J9 VM.

# Country
# Default value from the system property user.region
#com.ibm.osg.smf.country=US

# Default address and port of the Bundle Developer Server
# This property can be changed at runtime via the command line option setp[rop]
com.ibm.osg.smf.bd.server=localhost:8080

# Default webapp name that the SMF Bundle Developer Server is using.
# This property can be changed at runtime via the command line option setp[rop]

# If this flag is true, client can only connect to the SMF Bundle Developer
# server. All transactions will go through the server to satisfy requirements
# by the service provider in regards to security, accounting, etc, but mostly
# billing. This means that only the smfbd:/ URL protocol is allowed.
# This property can be changed at runtime via the command line option setp[rop]
#com.ibm.osg.smf.bd.smfbdProtocolOnly=false

# Show bundle download statics.
# A dot is printed for the specified number of bytes received and a summary
# with the total number of bytes received and the time it took is shown.
# Default is false (statistic output disabled).

#com.ibm.osg.smf.bd.showDownloadStatistics=false
#com.ibm.osg.smf.bd.showDownloadStatistics.bytesPerDot=1024

# DependencyAdmin bundle properties.
# Used by the DependencyAdmin bundle to calculate bundle dependencies
# and to perform bundle garbage collection.
# Default values are true.

# Calculate dependent bundles based on imported and exported packages.

# Flag that indicates whether or not the SMF framework should publish
# FrameworkEvent errors when native code libraries can not be found in the
# bundles data area.  It is possible that the library will subsequently be
# found by the Runtime.loadLibrary(String) implementation in the VM and the
# errors may not be relevant in some situations.
# Default is true - publish these errors.
com.ibm.osg.smf.publishFindLibraryErrors=true

# Flag that indicates whether or not the SMF framework should publish
