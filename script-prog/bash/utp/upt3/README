These files are examples from the third edition of Unix Power Tools,
published in 2002 by O'Reilly & Associates, Inc.  For more about
the book, please see http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/upt3/.

Notes:

1) Some of the programs in the archive are fairly old and may require
   some porting work to run on your particular version of Unix and/or
   with your shell. O'Reilly & Associates can't provide porting support
   for this code.

2) Some of the filenames in this archive start with a ".".
   To see them, use the ls -a option.

3) Some of the files in this archive (for example, nup and ndown)
   are hard links to the same file.  If your system supports
   symbolic links and you'd prefer them, you can replace hard links
   with symlinks by using a series of commands like this:

   rm ndown
   ln -s nup ndown
