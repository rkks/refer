	This directory contains:

gensource		called by mkmenu
mkmenu			use to generate scripts that source each other
script.template		example of a menuing script (self contained)

	The idea here is to show two ways of writing scripts
that use menus.  They call grabchars.

	"script.template" is pretty straightforward.  It can be used
as the basis of csh program contained within one file.  I show
the use of three aliases:  push_point, pop_point, and local_point,
which allow you to break csh scripts into "functions".

	"mkmenu" and "gensource" go further.  They allow you to have
a directory, "menus", which contains csh files that can source each
other.  You can set up some program with, say, 2 or 3 files, and then
go ahead and start using it...but, you can also write a new routine
or two that call routines from the first program, and so on.  Eventually
you'll have a directory full of routines, and putting together a new
"program" would be a matter of defining a menu that ties the right
routines together.
