Files whose names end in ".shar" are shell archives.
To extract files from these archives, first make a new directory
(for an archive named foo.shar, you might name the directory foo).
Then use one of the following two methods:

1) Edit the shar file to remove everything before the first line
   that starts with a "#" character.  (You may want to save this
   header information in a separate file; it can be useful.)
   Then save the file and feed it to a Bourne-type shell (sh,
   or a version like bash -- but *not* csh or tcsh) like this:

     sh foo.shar

2) Use an "unshar" utility to extract the files automatically.
