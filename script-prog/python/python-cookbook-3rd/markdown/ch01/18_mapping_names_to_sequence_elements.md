# Mapping Names to Sequence Elements

## Problem

- You have code that accesses list or tuple elements by position, but this makes the code somewhat difficult to read at times. Youâ€™d also like to be less dependent on position in the structure, by accessing the elements by name.

## Solution

- __`collections.namedtuple()`__ provides these benefits, while adding minimal overhead over using a normal tuple object.


```python
from collections import namedtuple

Subscriber = namedtuple('Subscriber', ['addr', 'joined'])
sub = Subscriber('jonesy@example.com', '2012-10-19')
sub
```




    Subscriber(addr='jonesy@example.com', joined='2012-10-19')




```python
print(sub.addr)
print(sub.joined)
```

    jonesy@example.com
    2012-10-19


- `namedtuple` is interchangeable with a tuple and supports all of the usual tuple operations such as indexing and unpacking.


```python
print(len(sub))
addr, joined = sub
print(addr)
print(joined)
```

- A major use case for named tuples is decoupling your code from the position of the elements it manipulates. So, if you get back a large list of tuples from a database call, then manipulate them by accessing the positional elements, your code could break if, say, you added a new column to your table. Not so if you first cast the returned tuples to namedtuples.

- Here is the code using ordinary tuples


```python
def compute_cost(records): 
    total = 0.0
    for rec in records:
        total += rec[1] * rec[2]
    return total
```

- Here is a version that uses a `namedtuple`


```python
from collections import namedtuple

Stock = namedtuple('Stock', ['name', 'shares', 'price'])

def compute_cost(records):
    total = 0.0
    for rec in records:
        s = Stock(*rec)
        total += s.shares * s.price
    return total

# Some Data
records = [
    ('GOOG', 100, 490.1),
    ('ACME', 100, 123.45),
    ('IBM', 50, 91.15)
]

print(compute_cost(records))
```

## Discussion

- Be aware that unlike a dictionary, a `namedtuple` is immutable. If you need to change any of the attributes, it can be done using the `_replace()` method of a `namedtuple` instance


```python
s = Stock('ACME', 100, 123.45)
print(s)
s.shares = 75
```

    Stock(name='ACME', shares=100, price=123.45)



    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)

    <ipython-input-8-08525960b121> in <module>()
          1 s = Stock('ACME', 100, 123.45)
          2 print(s)
    ----> 3 s.shares = 75
    

    AttributeError: can't set attribute



```python
s = s._replace(shares=75)
s
```




    Stock(name='ACME', shares=75, price=123.45)



- We can also use `_replace()` method to populate named tuples that have optional or missing fields.


```python
from collections import namedtuple
Stock = namedtuple('Stock', ['name', 'shares', 'price', 'date', 'time'])

# Create a prototype instance
stock_prototype = Stock('', 0, 0.0, None, None)

# Function to convert a dictionary to a Stock
def dict_to_stock(s):
    return stock_prototype._replace(**s)

a = {'name': 'ACME', 'shares': 100, 'price': 123.45}
dict_to_stock(a)
```




    Stock(name='ACME', shares=100, price=123.45, date=None, time=None)




```python
b = {'name': 'ACME', 'shares': 100, 'price': 123.45, 'date': '12/17/2012'}
dict_to_stock(b)
```




    Stock(name='ACME', shares=100, price=123.45, date='12/17/2012', time=None)
