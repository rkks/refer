Ver .92 -
	Finally figured out how to generate an EOF on a terminal (stty 0 but 
you knew that already ;). Whole module needs a spring cleaning but seems to be
pretty functional. After the (later) introduction of a POSIX stty function the
code involving stty should get a little cleaner.
	Interact, interconnect and expect should all benefit from the EOF fix.
interconnect also looks for FH exceptions, which it treats as EOFs.
Ver .94 -
	Think I fixed the problem of opening /dev/tty. Should work now. Also 
fixed a typo which caused the initial value of Log_Stdout to be set wrong.
Ver .95 -
	Linux had this bizarre problem of stty occasionally not returning when
setting raw -echo. My solution was to run it twice, once for raw and once for
echo. The real solution is of course to write an stty function using the POSIX
module.. any volunteers? :-)
ver .96 -
	Fixed a couple of idiot mistakes concerning DEBUG mode and printing
debug info to STDERR. Changed some debugging spots so debugging info will 
always be printed in readable escaped format rather than raw input.
ver .97 -
	Forced baud rate to get set at startup to make sure it wasn't set to 0
and sending EOFs. Linux now hangs consistently. It will probably not work until
I get to the stty module. Sigh. Time to stop being lazy :)
	Also forced complete handle flushing after handles are opened. Probably
a bit anal but I'd rather err on the side of safety.
	After the stty problem gets fixed I'll probably change over eveything
to use the IO::Pty module. 
ver .972 -
	Fixed setpgrp to be setsid. Oops. Processes opening /dev/tty should be
much happier now.
ver .98 -
	Changed everything. Now requires IO::Tty and uses IO::Stty. This
should make it work on any posix-supporting platform that includes a method
of obtaining a pty. Got rid of the 'detach' stuff, as it cluttered stuff up
too much. Do your own forking.
	Default settings are now done by directly setting Expect::Values, such
as $Expect::Debug and $Expect::Log_Stdout. Things now use 'spawn ids' and
'handle ids' instead of handle numbers. This makes debugging a little more 
sensible.
	Though there may be more bugs in the ver. I'm hopeful it should prove
to be much more stable, reliable, intuitive and portable than previously.
ver .99 -
	Changed expect() to return the index of the matched pattern + 1. This
enables the 'quick and dirty'   $process->expect($timeout,'patern') || die;
sort of behavior.
ver 1.00 -
	exp_close no longer sends an exp_kill() to the process. This was kind
of a dumb thing to do in the first place. Processes should go away after they
are close()d. In fact, there really isn't any point in using exp_close. Just
use $process->close();. -This isn't true as of 1.03, where soft and hard close
were added to help deal with buffering issues.
ver 1.01 -
	Dropped process still alive during expect. Sometimes the process dies
before the handle finishes getting read. Fixed a typo that caused a response
of 'child process died' if a successfull pattern had a null value.
	Added the ability to do expect() literals instead of regular
expressions. see $process->use_regexps and the package global 
$Expect::Use_Regexps.
	Fixed internals to work with the documented fashion for using file
ojects. everything is internally represented as ${*$process}{exp_variable} 
instead of ${*$process}{variable}. Pids should be checked with 
$process->pid() now, since $process->{Pid} no longer exists.
	exp_kill() is obsolete. Use kill($signal,$process->pid()).
ver 1.02 -
	Killed the $Expect::Use_Regexps stuff. Changed expect to look for '-re'
strings indicating the subsequent pattern is to be matched as a regular
expression.
ver 1.03 -
	Reworked expect() to make the code more fluid. Removed ~50 lines of
cruft. Added soft_close() and hard_close() (see Expect.pod for details).
ver 1.04 -
	Made all handles exp_inited autoflush. IO::Pty does the spawned 
processes for us. All regexp patterns passed to expect() are now 
multiline matched-- this makes matching ^ work for the beginning of lines.
Unfortunately due to limitations in perl matching $ as the end of a line
doesn't work if you are being returned \r\n instead of just \n. In this case
you can use \r?$ to match the end of a line.
	exp_stty now checks to make sure the FH is a tty.
ver 1.05 -
	Added debug level '3'. Fixed/added to tutorial, fixed a couple of
minor bugs.
ver 1.06 -
	Added exp_before(), exp_after(), exp_match(), exp_match_number(),
exp_error().
ver 1.07 -
	Changed the ver by .01 so I could get it up on CPAN :P
