	The tutorial is in order of how I would want to learn to use this tool.
very briefly, here's an index:

	1. Introduction, how/why one would want to use this tool.
	2. Spawn, expect- how to talk to a process.
	3. Debugging.
	4. Interacting with a spawned process.
	5. Monkeying with tty settings. Good for grabbing passwords, among
other things.
	6. Miscellaneous extra functions.

	Let me know if there's something you'd like to see that isn't here.
