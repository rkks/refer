	Expect.pm Ver. 1.07

	To install Expect you will also need IO::Stty which will be in the same
directory as you found this package, currently at ftp://ftp.habit.com/pub/perl.
You will also need IO::Tty which can be found in Graham Barr's directory on any
CPAN site. For each of these the usual perl Makefile.PL;make;make install
should work. I haven't implemented a make test for either IO::Stty or Expect.
It would probably be wise to read the docs on IO::Tty before doing a make
install with it.

	The Expect for Perl module was inspired more by the functionality the
Tcl tool provides than any previous Expect-like tool such as Comm.pl or
chat2.pl.  I've had some comments that people may not have heard of the
original Tcl version of Expect, or where documentation (book form) on Expect
may be obtained.
	The Tcl version of expect is a creation of Don Libes (libes@nist.gov).
The Tcl Expect home page is http://expect.nist.gov/.
	Don has written an excellent in-depth tutorial of the Tcl Expect,
which is _Exploring Expect_. It is the O'reilly book with the monkey on the
front. Don has several references to other articles on the Expect web page.

	As always, please let me know if there's something you'd like to see
documented that isn't. Please check the included FAQ and tutorial directory
first. :-)

	Thanks,
