NAME
       stty - change and print terminal line settings

SYNOPSIS
       stty [setting...]
       stty {-a,-g,-v,--version}

DESCRIPTION

       This is the PERL POSIX compliant stty. This 'man' page is a 
       hacked to hell version of the GNU stty page with all the 
       non-POSIX crap stripped out. I suppose if someone really
       wanted to bitch about some obscure copyright issues I 
       could write my own but I almost died of boredom just
       writing the module.

       stty  accepts  the  following  non-option  arguments  that
       change  aspects  of  the terminal line operation.  A `[-]'
       before a capability means that it can  be  turned  off  by
       preceding it with a `-'. 

       Control settings:


       [-]parenb
              Generate parity bit in output and expect parity bit
              in input.

       [-]parodd
              Set odd parity (even with `-').

       cs5 cs6 cs7 cs8
              Set character size to 5, 6, 7, or 8 bits.

       [-]hupcl [-]hup
              Send a hangup signal when the last  process  closes
              the tty.

       [-]cstopb
              Use two stop bits per character (one with `-').

       [-]cread
              Allow input to be received.

       [-]clocal
              Disable modem control signals.

       system.   They are set with the syntax `name value', where
       the names are listed below and  the  value  can  be  given
       either literally, in hat notation (`^c'), or as an integer
       which may start with `0x' to indicate hexadecimal, `0'  to
       indicate  octal,  or  any other digit to indicate decimal.
       Giving a value of `^-' or `undef'  disables  that  special
       character.


       intr   Send an interrupt signal.

       quit   Send a quit signal.

       erase  Erase the last character typed.

       kill   Erase the current line.

       eof    Send an end of file (terminate the input).

       eol    End the line.

       start  Restart the output after stopping it.

       stop   Stop the output.

       susp   Send a terminal stop signal.

       Special settings:


       min N  Set the minimum number of characters that will sat-
              isfy a read until the time value has expired,  when
              -icanon is set.

       time N Set  the  number of tenths of a second before reads
              time out if the min number of characters  have  not
              been read, when -icanon is set.

       N      Set the input and output speeds to N.  N can be one
              of: 0 50 75 110 134 134.5 150 200 300 600 1200 1800

              same  as 19200; extb is the same as 38400.  0 hangs
              up the line if -clocal is set.

              Print all current settings in human-readable  form.

       -g
              Print all current settings in a form  that  can  be
