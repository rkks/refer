This is a packaging of the Perl Power Tools with a Makefile.PL.
More info on the Perl Power Tools project can be found at 
(http://language.perl.com/ppt).

All the code is copyright the respective author(s), please see the source 
code or man page for the program to find out who that is.  Each program
has its own terms of redistribution, please see the source code of
the programs for that as well.

If it is found useful enough, I'll upload it to CPAN.  I am unclear
as to the current status of the Perl Power Tools, so I don't want to
do that if someone else is working on this.

What you see here is the easy part, I only included the files that I
could easily drop into a Makefile.PL structure without having to think
about namespacing, or including modules not currently on CPAN.

INSTALLATION:

tar -xvzf PerlPowerTools-0.1.tar.gz
cd PerlPowerTools-0.1
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test (nothing will happen here yet)
make install

I have set PREFIX to /usr/local/ppt for now, as these tools will
replace your system tools otherwise.  Replacing ls by default seems
like a bad idea.  (Feel free to change PREFIX to /usr if you want to
do that).

TODO:

The harder convertions (make, tar, and spell being good examples)

Test cases for everything.  There were some included in the PPT package
but they were specific to the individual directory structure.  I was lame
and have not yet taken the time to add them.

Man pages for those commands that don't have them (there are a few included).
