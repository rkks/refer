=head1 DESCRIPTION

Perl Power Tools (aka the Unix Reconstruction Project) is a rewrite of all the basic
UNIX commands in perl, as well as many of the BDS games.  
This is done for at least 2 reasons:

=over 4

=item 1

Its cool!  In the modern day and age there is no reason that B<ls> needs to be compiled
code.  

=item 2

to portability onto other platforms.

=head1 HISTORY

Perl Power Tools was originally conceived of by Tom Christiansen back in 1999.  A
lot of work was done on it at that time.  It has since laid dormant for quite a while.  In
May of 2001 Casey West and Sean Dague decided it was high time to revive this
project, specifically to get it CPANable.  This is where we are today.
