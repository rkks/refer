We are heavily working on this book and that means several things:

#. **It's not done**. We will be releasing new chapters from time to time and updating existing chapters on the go.
#. **We love your support**. If you find any errors or have suggestions, please use our feedback system (the "Create" and "View" links on the top of each page). It will create a new ticket-entry in our ticket system and help us to keep track.
#. **Be patient.** We are working in our spare time on the book and we depend on the support of our companies and family.

**Enjoy!**
