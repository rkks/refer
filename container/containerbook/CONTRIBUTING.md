# Contributing

:+1::tada: First, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines to contribute to the ContainerBook, which is hosted at (https://github.com/containerbook/containerbook/) on GitHub.

## Licensing

You provide us the contributions under [Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) license for text and [BSD](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) license for code. We keep us the rights to print a book based on the provided content. We can not ensure that everyone will then be correctly named, but we will do the best. This is just that you understand what you are about todo:-). 

Still interested? Cool. Welcome!

## Issues

Each chapter on the containerbook (http://containerbook.org) has several 'issue' reporting links. Please use these when you find a spelling error or another issue in the text. This will help us to identify the section later. The issue link will let you create or view the issues of this particular chapter.

The issues can be foud at (https://github.com/containerbook/containerbook/issues)

## Patch Contribution

We use the standard github pull requests for merging your fork of the book back to this one. You can find more information at (https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

## Chapter Contribution

You might feel adventures and are willing to contribute a full chapter. Your name will then be placed on the chapter for your reference. For this crate a new chaprer folder (e.g. ch99) and write your content using [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org) markup. We will then place the chapter into the chapter queue and when it's ready we will sort it into the table of contents.

## Translations

So you speak something else then english. Great! Feel free to translate the book into your language. For this clone the repository and then later create a pull request that we can sort this in. Before you start you should contact us on gitter to make sure there is no overlap.

Note: The infrastructure is not yet there, but soon we should be ready for translations.
