/**
 * A simple hash table supporting basic operations, for interviewing question purposes.
 * (!!) Does not handle resizes as of yet. (Resize would require considering the table load factor and performing 
 * a rehash of its entire contents). (Resize is usually performed when the hash table load factor, that is, 
 * "number_of_items / "number_of_buckets" is beyond a predefined threshold)
 *
 * Underlying data structure is a vector (array) and using closed addressing, and using
 * std::map for chainings (this in turn uses red-black trees and as such ensures logarithmic insertion/find complexity)
