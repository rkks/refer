Used address space must be smaller than actual address
space by at least XXX bits (3?). Otherwise nasty allocation
bugs may occure when the density is high.
 - not-enough bit space.


Test:
 - pessimistic distribution (ie: only last bits populated)
 - optimistic distribution (ie: only top bits populated)
