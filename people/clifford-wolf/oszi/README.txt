This is a tiny tool for using your PCs soundcard as low-cost low-frequency
oscilloscope. Beware of the code: it is a bloody hack!

This program is using SDL for accessing the computers display and does support
OSS, Alsa and Portaudio for accessing the soundcard. So it should be portable
to all major operating systems. However: I have only tested it on Linux.

Happy hacking!
