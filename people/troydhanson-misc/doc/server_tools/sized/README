sized is a utility to keep a directory pruned to under a certain file size.
It does not recurse, so its only meant to be used on flat directories. It 
simply counts up the file sizes and deletes old files after a size threshold
is reached. 

It operates in either a single pass mode or as a daemon. In daemon mode it
operates continuously by using inotify to observe when files in the directory
are closed. The directory can actually exceed the size threshold while files
are being written, but when they are closed, the threshold is tested.

Single pass mode:

	sized -o -s 10m /dir

Daemon ("continuous") mode:

	sized -c -s 10m /dir

You can use k/m/g suffixes for kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes. You can also
use a percentage like "-s 10%" to indicate "10% of the filesystem" where /dir
resides.
