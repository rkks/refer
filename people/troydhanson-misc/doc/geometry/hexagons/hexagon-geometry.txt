Geometry notes for drawing hexagons
-----------------------------------
Troy D. Hanson

I once wrote a program to draw some hexagons. After re-learning some
high school trig (thanks, teachers!) I wrote these notes to remember
the technique.

You can draw a hexagon by hand by drawing a rectangle "1 unit" high
and about twice as wide (1.7 units). Then give it a triangular hat 
whose height is half that of the rectangle. Put a reflection of the
hat below the rectangle.

To do that in a computer program we need a drawing system and some 
vertices. 

Vertices
--------
Assume an xy drawing plane with +x and +y going right and down.
In other words a drawing plane that has 0,0 at the top left with
increasing x,y going down and to the right. The HTML5 canvas has
this coordinate system.

I'll list the six vertices in clockwise order, starting from the
left-most upper one. In other words if the hexagon is oriented with
its peaky points straight up and down, my 0,0 (initial vertex)
is shown here along with the clockwise order of vertices:

          x               2  
-0,0-->  x x             1 3        
         x x             6 4        
          x               5        

The six vertices listed in this order are:

               x        y
1.             0        0
2.     sqrt(3)/2    -(1/2)
3.       sqrt(3)        0
4.       sqrt(3)        1
5.     sqrt(3)/2      3/2
6.             0        1

That's all you need. Connect those vertices with lines and you get a hexagon.

To draw tiled hexagons, translate. For horizontal neighbors, offset the x
component of the starting vertex by the hexagon's width, sqrt(3). Vertical 
neighbors have their y component offset by 1 unit, and their x component by
half a hexagon width (that is, sqrt(3)/2)).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Derivation
============================================================================
To find the hexagon's vertices in an xy coordinate system, we can draw a unit
hexagon, then use knowledge of its edges (all 1 unit) and its interior angles
(all 120 degrees) then use some triangle math to figure out the exact relative
positions of each vertex.

We know the six angles inside the hexagon (angles between adjacent sides)
are each 120 degrees. (I had to look it up, but the rule for the interior
angle of any regular n-gon is (n-2) × 180° / n).  To find the hexagon's
vertices, take a triangle - we'll take the one formed by the bottom three
vertices of the hexagon, and work out the points. (Afterward the remaining
hexagon vertices are relatively obvious from the unit edges and the mirror
image of the bottom triangle). Here's the bottom triangle of the hexagon.

         x x             6 4        
          x               5        
      
This one does not have a right angle in it. We want a triangle with a right
angle in it so we can use "sohcahtoa" (thank you, again my high school trig
teacher). Since this triangle is left-right symmetrical, take its left half. 
In other words, discard vertex 4; replace it with a vertex at the midpoint
from (6-4).  Now we have a new triangle with a right angle at that position
(labeled dot below).

         x.              6.        
          x               5        
      
We ultimately want to get the horizontal (x) distance between 6-5, and the
vertical (y) distance between 6-5 so we can put a xy coordinate on each vertex.
Here x and y are the length of the triangle's two sides other than the hypotenuse.

We first need to know the three angles of this triangle: one is the 90-degree
right angle, and the other two angles are:
 
The angle at vertex 5: since the original angle 
 (between the adjacent sides of the hexagon connected there) was 120, the half
 triangle we just made has a 60 degree angle between the vertical
 line rising from vertex 5 and the edge (5-6). 

The angle at vertex 6: using the triangle rule about angles add to 180 
 we now know the angle at vertex 6 is 30 degrees. That's the angle between the 
 horizontal line extending right from vertex 6, and the 5-6 hypotenuse below.

Now we use trig: to get the vertical y distance between 6-5, we use the "soh" 
part of sohcahtoa: sin(30)=y/1 (thus y=1/2); y is the vertical component of
distance between 6 and 5, or to say it another way, the distance the bottom
peak of the hexagon hangs below the adjacent two vertices.  

To get the horizontal x distance between 5-6, use trig again with the "cah"
part of sohcahtoa. cos(30)=x/1 (thus x=sqrt(3)/2); x is the horizontal
distance that the peak is from the left or right of the hexagon.  Since the
peak is in the horizontal middle, the total hexagonal width is simply twice
that, sqrt(3).

Incidentally the denominator of 1 above comes from the length of the 
hypotenuse (the edge from 5-6), which is 1 because this is a unit hexagon.

Last is just to make a diagram of a unit hexagon, and fill in the vertex
coordinates.

          x               2  
-0,0-->  x x             1 3        
         x x             6 4        
          x               5        

Since we put vertex 1 at (0,0), and this is a unit hexagon, we know that
vertex 6 is at (0,1). Vertex 3 and 4 are simply translated right by the
hexagon width, sqrt(3). Vertex 2 and 5 are in-between them horizontally
and 1/2 unit above and below. That gave us the coordinates above.
