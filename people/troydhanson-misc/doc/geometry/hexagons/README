This is a description of the geometry of hexagons, with sample
code for drawing hexagons.`

There is also a layout example that uses an input text file as
meaningless source data. Its lines are packed into tpl buffer and
ingested by the layout example. It generates a hashcode for
each line, then uses the hashcodes to render a hexagon chain.

usage: 

hextile-layout/layout-text-file -i /input/file > /tmp/some.tpl
draw-cairo/render-png -i /tmp/some.tpl -o /tmp/some.png
eog /tmp/some.png
