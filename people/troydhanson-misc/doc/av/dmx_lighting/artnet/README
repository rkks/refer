Art-Net is a DMX-over-Ethernet (UDP) protocol. While its general
history involves class A 2.x.x.x IP addresses and the use of 
broadcast on a dedicated Ethernet switch to discover devices, it
is in more modern versions able to use DHCP to assign IP addresses
and subnet masks to the devices. The upshot of this is that a DMX
lighting fixture (etc) whose IP address is known can be controlled
simply by sending UDP packets to it, whose payload encode the Art-
Net header followed by the DMX channels.

The use of DMX start-addresses (and universes) can be avoided in
this setup because each light has its own IP address, (so the
devices do not "share" the 512 DMX addresses- which is why the
offset set by the start-address was historically used). 

In summary the lights in Art-Net mode need only be plugged in,
set to DHCP, their IP addresses determined, and then UDP packets
sent (usually to the default Art-Net protocol) with the DMX settings
specific to that device. The example script sets 16 elements on one
fixture to individual RGB colors. Since there are 3 RGB bytes and
16 elements, there are 48 total "data" bytes. The selection of the
48-byte mode is hardcoded using the control interface on the lights.
