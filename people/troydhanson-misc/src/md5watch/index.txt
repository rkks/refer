This runs on an MD5 checksum on files in a directory hierarchy. It keeps a
record of all their MD5 values (by default in a file called `~/.md5hist`) so
that next time it is run, it can print out which files have changed.

Generally use this with `-u` (update) so it records the new MD5 hash (of changed
or new files), in addition to printing them. Without `-u`, it only prints them.

  % cd /tmp
  % echo hello > hello.txt
  % md5watch -u
  ./hello.txt new ...updated.
  % echo 'hello, world!' > hello.txt
  % md5watch -u
  ./hello.txt changed since Mon Dec 21 14:48:00 2009 ...updated.

You can place `md5watch -u` into cron like this to get a daily email of files
whose content has changed.  This example excludes the top-level logs directory
from being scanned.

  5 0 * * *       $HOME/bin/md5watch -e ./logs -u

While you could use `find` to list files modified in the last day (by
modification timestamp), `md5watch` actually tests whether the content has changed.
