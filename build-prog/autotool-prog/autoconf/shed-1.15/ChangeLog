1.15
  - file type descriptions
  - multi-byte editing (press 2 or 4)
  - case insensitive search
  - better backspace support
  - improved large-file support
  - units (K,M,G) support for jump command
  - -L / --length option
  - -n / --nofollow if --enable-nofollow configure option used (pretty useless)

1.14
  - experimental largefile support
  - --hex command line option
  - little interface fix for cygwin

1.13
  - binary editing (bit toggling)
  - minor interface improvments

1.12
  - read from stdin
  - fix for searching for values greater than 127 (duh!)
  - ^W added for search to be like pico (thought it was like that already)
  - ^H added for deleting input (should I be looking up the configured
    key from the env?)
  - minor fix in spacing
  - fixed bug when doing a repeat search by entering an empty string.
  - dump progress
  - --start fix

1.11
  - ^c handling (you can cancel when asked for input)
  - ^o save message :-)
  - --readonly option
  - --start option
  - preview mode (nice idea, but came out ugly, but have left it in anyway)
  - added extended ascii character display (also ugly!)
  - interface tidying
  - new keypresses!
  - more beeping on errors (can't remember what specifically)
  - ported to c
  - bit of code refactoring
  - added proper 'missing', 'install-sh' and 'mkinstalldirs' needed for RPM
    making. (not that I actually make one, but in case you do. Thanks to
    Dennis Bjorklund for info.

1.10
  - Fixed serious dump bug, where it would dump to the input file, overwriting
    its contents as it went.

1.09
  - Compiling with g++ 3.2 gave me a good screenful or two about some
    iostream deprectation, so all IO is now done with stdio (probably
    faster anyway)
  - Fixed bug with files whose size could not be obtained (devices etc).
  - Ignoring of ^C to prevent accidental quitting (see TODO)
  - Added configure script.

1.08
  - Added "repeat previous search" on R
  - Added handling of invalid digits when inputting numbers
  - Added checking for out-of-range inputs

1.07
  - Fixed some major search bugs (Thanks to Keith Williams for pointing them
    out)
  - Added ^L refresh
  - Added a very simple man page

1.06
  - Now a previous search string for each column
  - Improved error message when file could not be 'stat'ed
  - Pressing 'f' (find) now does search too

1.05
  - Fixed bug with toggling dec/hex mode on large files
  - Now checks if the argument is a directory. Before it would try and open
    the directory as a file and wouldn't do much.
  - On files where the file size could not be obtained (devices etc). offset
    column is now set to big

1.04
  - Made jump-to code more efficient - On large files it was taking a couple of
    seconds to jump from start to end

1.03
  - Fixed problem where screen wouldn't be redrawn after a resize
  - Tidied up redraw when resize takes place with cursor near EOF
  - Improved makefile's make install option. (I was using cp and chmod because
    I didn't know the install command :-) )

1.02
  - Fixed bug when using jump to end

1.01
  - Added <stdlib.h> for similar reasons as below

1.00
  - Same as 0.92, but decided it was ready for 1.00, as I can't
    be bothered to do any of the ideas at the moment. Only change
    was adding <string.h> to includes, because on my system it was
    getting included through another header. I tried building on
    another system and string.h wasn't getting included so needed
    to be explicitly included.

0.92
  - Support for read-only files.
  - Beeping when cursor is at a boundary, or when trying to
    edit a readonly file

0.91
  - Search strings can now be entered in any of the bases

0.90
  - First release to celebrate(?) it getting on sourceforge
