SHED (Simple Hex EDitor) v1.15

Shed is a program for viewing and editing non-text
files. The look and feel is designed to be similar
to that of pico's.

LICENSE
Shed is released under the GNU General Public License
(GPL). See COPYING for more information.

USAGE
****************************************************
BACKUP YOUR FILES FIRST!!!.
NB: Notice there is no save key. This is because the
file is not loaded into memory, so when you edit it,
the change is made directly to disk.
****************************************************

Type shed and a filename. If you're editing a file it
must be an existing file. If no filename is given,
or it is '-', then shed displays stdin.

The man page has information on command line options.

Each line of the shed display represents one byte of the
file. Each lines consists of the offset of that byte from
the start of the file, the ascii value of the byte, and
then the bytes value in various bases. All values are
unsigned.

Keys:

arrow keys       - move cursor around
pgup/^Y          - cursor up 16
pgdown/^V        - cursor down 16
home/^A          - start of line
end/^E           - end of line

space/e          - edit value of current byte.
                   You are asked to enter the new value in the format of the current
                   column the cursor is in - eg. if you are in the hex column, it will
                   ask for the new value in hex.

1,2,4            - set size of cursor in bytes, in the hex/dec/oct columns (and binary
                   if in traditional mode).

`                - toggle the endianness of multi-byte values (when cursor size is 2 or 4)

s, w, ^x, f, F3  - search.
                   Search string is asked for in the format of the current cursor column.
                   In ascii, just enter the string in ascii. In the others, enter the values
                   seperated by spaces - eg to search for ABC from the decimal column you
                   would enter "65 66 67" (without the quotes).

^f,^b            - search shortcut for forwards/backwards respectivly.

r,n,F3           - repeat previous search

t                - toggle whether offset numbers and cursor position etc are in dec or hex.

b                - toggle binary mode column behaviour (bit edit mode vs traditional)

d                - dump to file.

j                - jump to byte. enter a byte number, or 'top' or 'end'.

a                - change the mode of the ascii column (printable only/c-style extended chars/'man ascii' descriptions)

p                - turn on 'preview' mode.

x, ^x            - exit


When a command (except search) asks you for input, entering a
zero-length string will cancel the command, as will ^C.
When searching, entering a zero-length string will use the
previous search word, if one exists.

NOTES
shed can be used directly on devices (/dev/*) but it can not
obtain the length so you can overrun the length of the device.
