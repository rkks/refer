This is `sic', a minimal shell to illustrate the use of autoconf,
automake and autoconf.

Sic itself consists of the library, libsic.la, and the headers installed
in `/usr/local/include/sic', and is little more than a a syntax table
mechanism for associating parts of an input stream with consumer
functions.

This distribution also includes a sample shell, which reads input from
the command line and feeds it to this syntax mechanism, and a bunch of
standard builtin functions to provide basic shell functionality.  You
could easily make it work entirely differently by changing the way the
input stream is collected, and/or the set of builtins it has.
