This is `sic', a bare interpreter which is defined by runtime loadable
modules.  The name is a recursive acronym for "sic is cumulative", which
refers to the fact that it accumulates functionality at runtime.  It is
wrapped around Thomas Tanner's libltdl implementation from libtool-1.4,
so is able to load modules on just about any platform with a C compiler, 
and a reasonable C library.

Sic itself consists of the library, libsic.la, and the headers installed
in `/usr/local/include/sic', and is little more than a a syntax table
mechanism for associating parts of an input stream with consumer
functions.

This distribution also includes a sample shell, which reads input from
the command line and feeds it to this syntax mechanism, and a bunch of
modules to provide basic shell functionality.  You could easily make it
work entirely differently by changing the way the input stream is
collected, and/or the set of modules it loads.
